# Welcome

Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to download *A Little Bit of Laravel*, our collection of tips to help make small but noticeable improvements to your app.

This book was written by Joel Clermont and Aaron Saray.  Combined, we have over 4 decades of experience programming in web and open source technologies.  We've built many Laravel projects over the years and discovered a number of tips and tricks that have made our projects' performance, security and coding experience better.

We're excited to share these with you!

## How to Use This Book Effectively

You're already busy working on your app, so we planned these chapters as simple 1 or 2 page chunks for you to digest quickly.

To get the most benefit from this book, we encourage you to resist the urge to speed-read or just scan through it. Instead, read only **one chapter a day** and then see if there's a way to apply what you've learned to your app.  We're not asking for a full rewrite, just a few small tweaks to make everything better.

One tip a day for the next 3 work weeks - you can do this!  Let's go.

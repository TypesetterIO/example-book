**ps**... *when you read a book, do you "hear" a voice for the author? Like, make one up and sort of hear that in your head as you're reading? Or is that just something weird Aaron does... Anyway, if you want to hear the sweet, dulcet tones of the two authors, check out the [No Compromises Podcast](https://show.nocompromises.io).*
